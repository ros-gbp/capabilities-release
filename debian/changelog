ros-noetic-capabilities (0.3.0-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Bump CMake version to avoid CMP0048 warning (#89 <https://github.com/osrf/capabilities/issues/89>)
  * Fixed bug by pruning spec files by black/white lists #84 <https://github.com/osrf/capabilities/issues/84> from commaster90/fix-1
    This ensures ``GetCapabilitySpecs`` service returns the filtered specs.
  * Removed a faulty ``start_capability`` test.
    Can't rely on timing of calling ``stop_capability`` and then ``start_capability`` in quick succession, so this test can't be made to work reliably.
  * Updated discovery unit test.
  * Fixed typos in ``start_capabilities`` server.
  * Added test for restarting capabilities.
  * Export architecture_independent flag in package.xml
  * Changed to return an error if requested capability is already running.
    The ``start_capability`` service now returns an error code if it cannot start a capability because it is already running.
